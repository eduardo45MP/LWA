   - Utilize MongoDB for efficient storage and retrieval of task data.

3. **Responsive Design:**
   - Develop a responsive web application with Bootstrap for optimal user experience across devices.

4. **Security Measures:**
   - Implement secure user authentication using JWT tokens.
   - Ensure data encryption with HTTPS to protect user information.

5. **Scalability:**
   - Build a scalable architecture using a RESTful API for potential future enhancements.
   - Employ best practices for server deployment and hosting on platforms like Heroku.

## Features:

1. **Task Creation:**
   - Create tasks with RESTful API endpoints and MongoDB integration.

2. **Task Editing:**
   - Edit tasks with a user-friendly form and real-time updates using React.

3. **Task Deletion:**
   - Implement the ability to delete tasks securely with proper authorization.

4. **User Authentication:**
   - Use JWT tokens for secure user authentication and authorization.
